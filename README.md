# HackerWallpaperLocalHost
HackerWallpaperLocalHost is a cyber-themed web dashboard emulating a hacker terminal. It features dynamic fake data (names, IPs, passwords) and an FBI-themed background. This prototype has issues like poor scrolling, non-random data, and unoptimized design. Your help in improving it would be invaluableâ€”let's make it amazing together! ðŸš€
